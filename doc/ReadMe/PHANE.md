# The PHANE Project

***Phylogenetic Haskell Analytic Network Engine***

The Phylogenetic Haskell Analytic Network Engine (PHANE) project is collection of Haskell libraries exposing abstract interfaces intended for use general-purpose use by bioinformatics community.
The project is produced by the [American Museum of Natural History][AMNH-Website] (AMNH); specifically the [Ward Wheeler Lab][AMNH-Wheeler] of the [Invertebrate Zoology Department][AMNH-InvtZoo] as an undertaking of the mueseum's [computational sciences][AMNH-CompSci] initative.


## Libraries

The PHANE project provides a number of Haskell packages, each exposing one or more libraries.
All packages are located within the `pkg` directory.
Below are the packages provided:

  - [`PHANE-PhyloLib`][GitHub-PHANE-Lib-00]
  - [`PHANE-integration-tests`][GitHub-PHANE-Lib-01]
