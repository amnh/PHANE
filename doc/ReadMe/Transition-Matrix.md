PHANE Transition Matrix
=======================

Interface for defining transition measures between character state ambiguity groups within the "measure sub-system" of the [PHANE project][GitHub-PHANE].

Supports construction from pairwise distance matrix specifying the measure between a pair of symbols from an alphabet ($\Sigma$).

Defines both "pairwise" and threeway "measures" between pairs and triples of character state ambiguity groups.
