/** Fill a row in a two dimentional alignment
 *
 *  When pairwise alignment is performed, two dynamic characters are compared over a
 *  transformation cost matrix. Let's call them characters x and y written over
 *  some alphabet a of length |a|. Each base of x
 *  is represented by a column in the transformation cost matrix and each base of
 *  y by a row. However, note that the actual values that are added during the
 *  alignment are produced by comparing every single base of x with only |a|
 *  elements. Now, in order to to make these operations vectorizable, we perform
 *  the comparisons with |a| precalculated vectors. This puts in context the
 *  explanation of each parameter in the function.
 *
 *  @param nwMtx is the cost matrix row to be filled with values.
 *  @param pm is the row above nwMtx in the cost matrix being filled.
 *  @param gap_row is the cost of aligning each base in x with a gap.
 *  @param alg_row is the cost of aligning each base in x wit hthe base
 *  represented by the base of the row of nwMtx in y.
 *  @param dirMtx is the directional matrix for the backtrace
 *  @param c is the cost of an insertion. As an insertion can only occur for one
 *  particular base in the alphabet, corresponding to the base in y represented
 *  by the row that is being filled.
 *  @param st is the starting cell for the filling.
 *  @param end is the final cell for the filling.
 *  If you modify this code check algn_fill_3dMtx as there is sinwMtxilar code there
 *  used in the first plane of the alignment. It didn't use this function because
 *  the direction codes are different for three dimensional alignments.
